# Matching-App

This repository contains a starter ASP.NET Core Web API for a matchmaking application. The API uses Entity Framework Core with SQL Server.

## Building

Ensure the .NET SDK 7.0 or later is installed. From the `src/MatchingApp.Api` directory run:

```
dotnet restore
```

To run the API locally:

```
dotnet run
```

The API exposes endpoints under `/api/clients`.
